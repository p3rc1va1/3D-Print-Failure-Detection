This dataset contains images of 3D printer failures across a variety of print jobs spanning several types of printer, material, models, and colors. It can be used as the starting point for creating a computer vision model that monitors a print job and aborts it as soon as it becomes evident that there is a problem (and alerts you before wasting a ton of time and money on materials). It can also be used to do automated quality assurance on finished models to make sure they do not exhibit common defects.

A dataset of 276 images is provided, along with a pre-trained model you can try in your browser and deploy to several different edge devices.
