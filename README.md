# 3D Print Failure Detection
## Purpose:
This project is to prevent the printing filament waste at my University. The printers default metrics are very poorly designed and cant stop the printing process in time when something goes wrong. However, with this project I can not only detect the print failure sooner but also receive an email when it does so.

## Technical details:
- YOLO v12: https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo12/
- Dateset: https://universe.roboflow.com/additive-manufacturing-qa/3dprinting/dataset/6#
- Environment: Poetry
- Trained on Google Colab T4 GPU.
